1.- Move the .rar or .zip file to the location where you wish to set CReminders

2.- Extract the file, you will be left with a [CReminders] folder

3.- Go into that folder and run CReminders.exe

4.- Modify the info.txt file to add your reminders

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that commands.exe allows you to perform several useful features, such as:

show	
Quickly gives a preview of all reminders

deactivate	
Removes the program from the Registry and stops its execution. To reactivate it you must run CReminders.exe again

reset en	
Resets the info.txt file to its original state, in english. Note that this will delete all the reminders that you created
